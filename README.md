# Hack Cambridge 2022 - Farming Drone and AI

This repository consists of two AI models we made in the Hackathon to help in the farming of Corn.

The models are also deployed on to a web app which can be viewed at: https://farming-drone-ai.herokuapp.com/

The use of such models will be to be used in conjunction with drone footage to analyse crop-fields and map pests and weed infestation.

corn_leaf_disease_model determines whether a leaf is healthy or infected by pests
seedling_detection_model classifies the seedlings into corn or type of weed

The image data used to train the models were from these sources:
  - https://www.kaggle.com/qramkrishna/corn-leaf-infection-dataset
  - https://www.kaggle.com/vbookshelf/v2-plant-seedlings-dataset
